# CS500: Industrial Placement

The industrial placement provides students with employment for a short period of time in a real work environment and on a subject related to the curriculum of the Department of Computer Science.

Students can choose the course (by registering through Banner Web) during the Summer Semester of their third year of studies, earning 7.5 ECTS at the undergraduate level (provided the placement is deemed successful). The course is available to third-year students who have successfully completed the prerequisites, CS342: Databases and CS343: Software Engineering, at the start of the placement.

The process is coordinated by the University of Cyprus's [Career Center](https://www.ucy.ac.cy/careercentre/?lang=en), and the available placement positions are published through the platform [www.2beconnected.org.cy](https://www.2beconnected.org.cy) by organizations and companies.
